### Static map of areas where you can reach both Kumpula and Pitäjämäki in less than 30 minutes by public transport

I am studying in Kumpula Campus and my girlfriend is working in Pitäjämäki. In this work I wanted to find out the areas that would be suitable for both of us. The map shows areas that can be reached in less than 30 minutes from both places.
